Adds a context menu to save media {image, video, audio, link, page} in user-defined folders or directories relative to the default download location.

Rules-based file renaming and routing.

Option to save as shortcuts {.url, .desktop, .html redirect}.

The WebExtension API only allows saving into directories relative to the default download directory. Symlinks can be used to get around this limitation:

Windows: mklink /D C:\path\to\symlink D:\path\to\actual
macOS/Unix: ln -s /path/to/actual /path/to/symlink

<all_urls> permission is used to get around CORS on HTTP HEAD requests (to check for Content-Disposition headers)
tabs permission is used to get the active page's title.

Configure before use.
